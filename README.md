# User Profile App

This is a simple user profile application built with **React**. It's part of my learning process, specifically focused on understanding and implementing **state management** using the `useState` hook in React.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to explore and understand how **React's `useState` hook** works to manage component state in a functional component. By fetching random user data from an API and dynamically rendering the profile, I am learning how to:
- Use the `useState` hook to store and update state.
- Manage data flow within a React app.
- Update the UI based on state changes.

## Features
- Fetch random user data from an external API.
- Display user profile information such as name, email, location, and more.
- Handle asynchronous data fetching with React.
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **React** (for building the user interface)
- **useState** (for state management)
- **CSS** (for styling)

##  Focus
This project helped me:
- Understand how to use the `useState` hook to store and update data.
- Handle asynchronous operations like API fetching within React.
- Build dynamic components that re-render when the state changes.
